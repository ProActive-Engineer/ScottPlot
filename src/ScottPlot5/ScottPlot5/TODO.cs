    /* ### SCOTT'S RUNNING LIST OF UPCOMING TASKS ##    
     * DateTime tick generator
     *   IAxis.cs has lots of tick styling that should be a Axis.TickStyle
     * Manual tick generator
     * Make more marker class
     * Improve signal plot rendering when several repeated values produce a vertical height of zero
     * AutoScale() is called in the first render if SetAxisLimits() was used to set only a single axis value
     * Add offset X and offset Y support to signal plots
     * Multiplot (#1337)
     * Add more data source classes
     * Add XLabel(), YLabel(), and Title() shortcuts methods
     * Need Plot.Remove to match Plot.Add and maybe even Plot.GetPlottables()
     * Use something like an ILegendItemGenerator for each plottable so users can inject their own logic for formatting legend items
     * A label class that can draw rotated text at a point respecting alignment would be great (https://github.com/ScottPlot/ScottPlot/issues/2202#issuecomment-1499708534)
