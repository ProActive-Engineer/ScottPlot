# ScottPlot

***ScottPlot is an open-source interactive graphing library for .NET written in C#.*** The core of this project is a dependency-free portable class library which takes 2D arrays and graphs them (it can even create JPEG output in console applications). Interactive abilities are made available with a user control which is easy to drop into a windows forms application. ScottPlot was loosely inspired by matplotlib for Python.

***The master branch of this project currently contains no code.*** Check out the [latest development branches](https://github.com/swharden/ScottPlot/branches) if you're interested to see where this project is and is going. Development branches are being developed but are unsupported. For an outdated but working project, check out the interactive graphing solutions on the [C#-Data-Visualization](https://github.com/swharden/Csharp-Data-Visualization) project page.
