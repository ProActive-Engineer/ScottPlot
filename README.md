# ScottPlot

**ScottPlot is an open-source interactive graphing library for .NET written in C#.** It was written to simplify the task of interactively displaying data on a graph that you can left-click-drag to pan and right-click drag to zoom. Although ScottPlot was designed for interactive graphing of large datasets in a GUI environment, its core can generate graphs from within console applications. ScottPlot was loosely inspired by matplotlib for Python.
