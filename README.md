# ScottPlot
***ScottPlot is an open-source interactive graphing library for .NET written in C#.*** The core of this project is a dependency-free portable class which takes 2D arrays and graphs them (it can even create JPEG output in console applications). Interactive abilities are made available with a user control which is easy to drop into a windows forms application. ScottPlot was loosely inspired by matplotlib for Python

***This project is extremely early in the development cycle.*** Ultimately I want to distribute ScottPlot as a stable API (at which time its use will be documented with confidence and permanence). For now, this project should only be assessed for its experimental and educational value.
