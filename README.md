**ScottPlot is a free and open-source graphing library for .NET** which makes it easy to display data in a variety of formats (line plots, bar charts, scatter plots, etc.) with just a few lines of code (see the **[ScottPlot Cookbook](http://swharden.com/scottplot/cookbook)** for examples). User controls are available for WinForms, WPF, and Avalonia to allow interactive display of data. ScottPlot can be installed using NuGet.
