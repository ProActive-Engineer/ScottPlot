# ScottPlot

***ScottPlot is an open-source interactive graphing library for .NET written in C#.*** The core of this project is a portable class library which allows a user to supply figure dimensions and scale information and plot data directly on a bitmap buffer relying on ScottPlot to handle unit-to-pixel conversions, drawing of axis labels, tick marks, grid lines, etc. Although ScottPlot was designed for interactive graphing of large datasets in a GUI environment, its core can generate graphs from within console applications. ScottPlot was loosely inspired by matplotlib for Python.

> **WARNING: THIS PROJECT IS NOT READY FOR WIDESPREAD USE!** ScottPlot is still in the very early stages of development. Its API has not yet solidified, so building projects around it is not yet recommended. At this time, this repository is intended to track the development of this projet (rather than distribute it).
