**ScottPlot is a free and open-source plotting library for .NET** that makes it easy to interactively display large datasets. The [**ScottPlot Cookbook**](https://swharden.com/scottplot/cookbook) demonstrates how to create line plots, bar charts, pie graphs, scatter plots, and more with just a few lines of code.

### Major Versions

* See [**Releases**](https://github.com/swharden/ScottPlot/releases) for source code and notes for all versions

* **`ScottPlot 4.1`** is being actively-developed and is currently available as a pre-release package on NuGet. This version is faster than 4.0, supports multiple axes, and has a simpler API and a much better cookbook.

* **`ScottPlot 4.0`** is stable, available on NuGet, and has its own [branch](https://github.com/swharden/ScottPlot/branches) for continued bug fixes and refinements. However, new features are no longer being developed for this version.

### Plot in the Cloud

**This figure is an example of ScottPlot running in the cloud.** Once daily an [Azure Function](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/) logs the number of stars this repository has and creates a graph of the star history using ScottPlot. Since the output is simply a static image accessible by a URL, it can be displayed in places where JavaScript is not permitted like in this readme file. Rendering plots server-side allows automatically-updating plots to be displayed in many interesting places. Source code can be found in the [StarGraph](https://github.com/swharden/StarGraph) repository.
