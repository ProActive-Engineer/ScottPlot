**Review the ScottPlot Cookbook**
Before posting a question look over the latest [ScottPlot Cookbook](http://swharden.com/scottplot/cookbook) to see if your answer can already be found online.

**Review the ScottPlot Demo**
If your question involves a GUI (mouse tracking, launching new windows, showing values under the cursor, etc.) review the demos in the [ScottPlot Demo Application](http://swharden.com/scottplot/demo). Source code for this demo application (for Windows Forms and WPF) can be found in `/src`

var plt = new ScottPlot.Plot();
plt.PlotWinningLotteryNumbers();
plt.saveFig("helloYacht.png");
```

**Here's an example of what I'd like to do:**
If you're trying to create a special type of plot, find an image of what you like on Google and paste it here. This will help us create the best answer to get you as close to your goal as possible.
