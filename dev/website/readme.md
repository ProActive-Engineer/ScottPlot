# ScottPlot Documentation

Traditionally the ScottPlot documentation has been the cookbook webpage and the demo application source code. I'd like to break this up into 4 online documentation sections:

* **ScottPlot Quickstart** - Create a new project, install ScottPlot, and plot data in less than a minute.

* [**ScottPlot Overview**](overview.md) - A summary of the primary concepts of ScottPlot. The goal is to create the minimum number of topics and examples that new users can review to maximally understand how to use ScottPlot.

* [**ScottPlot FAQ**](faq.md) - Answers to common questions asked by a minority of users. Answers often contain links to cookbook examples or a reference to the demo program source code for extended reading.

* [**ScottPlot Cookbook**](cookbook.md) - Examples of all plot types and advanced customization of plottables, axes, and figure styling.
